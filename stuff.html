        <p>Howdy Troops! :saluting_face:
            Thanks for all of your contributions and enthusiasm for the Presentation this morning.
            During the call we discussed.
            :point_right: Readme
            Each of your hackathon and individual projects should have be accompanied by a README.md document. Written using Markdown language, the README provides information about the purpose of your project, what it does and why it is useful. The README.md file should be located in your project repository and should contain multiple sections that credit any  sources used, explain the design and development process you used, and also demonstrate your testing and validation methods.
            We can use the following resources to create and refine detailed and descriptive README documents.
            Markdown: https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/
            Am I responsive image generator: https://ui.dev/amiresponsive

            README Template: A template for the README.md file for Code Institute student projects
            :point_right: Testing & Validation
            We also spoke about testing and validating our code. We want to prove to the user, project owner and other stakeholders that the application has been thoroughly checked, during development, and also before and after deployment.
            Here are some other links to some basic validation and testing resources we might need.
            W3 Schools HTML Validator: https://validator.w3.org/
            Jigsaw CSS Validator: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
            WCAG Contrast Checker: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wcag-color-contrast-check/plnahcmalebffmaghcpcmpaciebdhgdf
            Thanks again for all of your input and feedback again folks.
            You are all doing outstanding work.
            Keep going :coding:
